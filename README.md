<h1>Ping and portscan app for nextcloud</h1>
<h3>A Nextcloud app that lets you ping and portscan from the server.</h3>
An essential app for all net admins, I recommend restricting it to only admins. This should work for Linux or Windows servers. Linux servers require fping installed, if it's not already.

Nextcloud Hub 10 (31.0.6) is compatible, the icons at the top may look funny, but the app does still work!
